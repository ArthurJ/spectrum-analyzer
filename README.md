# Rust: library for frequency spectrum analysis using FFT
A simple and fast `no_std` library to get the frequency spectrum of a digital signal (e.g. audio) using FFT.
It follows the KISS principle and consists of simple building blocks/optional features. In short, this is 
a convenient wrapper around several FFT implementations which you can choose from during compilation time
via Cargo features.

**I'm not an expert on digital signal processing. Code contributions are highly welcome! ðŸ™‚**

**The MSRV (minimum supported Rust version) is 1.51 Stable because this crate needs the 
"resolver" feature of Cargo to cope with build problems occurring in `no_std`-builds.**

## I want to understand how FFT can be used to get a spectrum
Please see file [/EDUCATIONAL.md](/EDUCATIONAL.md).

## How to use (including `no_std`-environments)
Most tips and comments are located inside the code, so please check out the repository on
Github! Anyway, the most basic usage looks like this:

### FFT implementation as compile time configuration via Cargo features
By default this crate uses the `real`-module from the great `microfft`-crate. It's the fastest implementation
and as of version `v0.5.0` there should be no valid reason why you should ever change this. The multiple features
are there mainly for educational reasons and to support me while programming/testing.

### Cargo.toml
```toml
# ONLY NEEDED FOR `no_std`-builds!
# fixes `no_std` build problems caused by wrong feature resolution of Cargo
# This works since Rust 1.51 (stable)
resolver = "2"

# by default feature "microfft-real" is used
[dependencies]
spectrum-analyzer = "<latest version, see crates.io>"

# or if you need another feature (FFT implementation)
[dependencies.spectrum-analyzer]
default-features = false # important! only one feature at a time works!
version = "<latest version, see crates.io>"
features = ["rustfft-complex"] # or on of the other features
```

### your_binary.rs
```rust
use spectrum_analyzer::{samples_fft_to_spectrum, FrequencyLimit};
use spectrum_analyzer::windows::hann_window;

fn main() {
    // This lib also works in `no_std` environments!
    let samples: &[f32] = get_samples(); // TODO you need to implement the samples source
    // apply hann window for smoothing; length must be a power of 2 for the FFT
    let hann_window = hann_window(&samples[0..4096]);
    // calc spectrum
    let spectrum_hann_window = samples_fft_to_spectrum(
        // (windowed) samples
        &hann_window,
        // sampling rate
        44100,
        // optional frequency limit: e.g. only interested in frequencies 50 <= f <= 150?
        FrequencyLimit::All,
        // optional per element scaling function, e.g. `20 * log10(x)`; see doc comments
        None,
        // optional total scaling at the end; see doc comments
        None,
    );

    for (fr, fr_val) in spectrum_hann_window.data().iter() {
        println!("{}Hz => {}", fr, fr_val)
    }
}
```

## Example visualization
In the following example you can see a basic visualization of frequencies `0 to 4000Hz` for 
a layered signal of sine waves of `50`, `1000`, and `3777Hz` @ `44100Hz` sampling rate. The peaks for the 
given frequencies are clearly visible. Each calculation was done with `2048` samples, i.e. â‰ˆ46ms.

**The noise (wrong peaks) also comes from clipping of the added sine waves!**

### Spectrum *without window function* on samples
Peaks (50, 1000, 3777 Hz) are clearly visible but also some noise.

### Spectrum with *Hann window function* on samples before FFT
Peaks (50, 1000, 3777 Hz) are clearly visible and Hann window reduces noise a little bit. Because this example has few noise, you don't see much difference.

## Building and Executing Tests
To execute tests you need the package `libfreetype6-dev` (on Ubuntu/Debian). This is required because
not all tests are "automatic unit tests" but also tests that you need to check visually, by looking at the
generated diagram of the spectrum.

## Trivia / FAQ
### Why f64 and no f32?
I tested f64 but the additional accuracy doesn't pay out the ~40% calculation overhead (on x86_64).
### What can I do against the noise?
Apply a window function, like Hann window or Hamming window. But I'm not an expert on this.
